# Tkinter
Projects made with tkinter (including a calculator and 2 weather apps)

The calculator is a simple calculator for calculating basic math problems. More advanced scientific calculator in the works

Check out the images file to see a simple image viewer. Just put your own pictures in the pictures directory to scroll through them, or download the pictures provided for a sampling

The address book provides a simple gui that creates a database with addresses

The weather and urlToImage files were test files used towards the creation of the final weather app. airQuality.py can give you the air quality or current weather for a specified zip code.
To use the weather and air quality apps you will need to grab your own API Keys. For weather only, visit https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up, create an account and grab the API key. For air quality, you will need your openweathermap api key you just generated, and one from creating an account at https://docs.airnowapi.org/account/request/. Fill in the api_key = {} sections of the code and you are ready to go.
